# A Banner of Pride
Created by the LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft, this flag represents 40 different individual LGBTQIA+ communities—with one powerful graphic that reflects a message of unity, solidarity and intersectionality. We’re making it available here on GitHub for everyone to use and build on. Because Pride should be open source. Learn more about [Pride at Microsoft.](https://unlocked.microsoft.com/pride/)
